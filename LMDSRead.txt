Introduction

LMDS - http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-05-winter/Papers/Landmarks/Silva_landmarks5.pdf

LMDS implementation - https://github.com/danilomotta/LMDS/blob/master/mds.py
 
LMDS can be used as a dimensionality reduction technique to visualise EA population dynamics to understand algorithm performance [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342376991_Visualising_Evolution_History_in_Multi-_and_Many-Objective_Optimisation].

The following tool can be used to visualise population dynamics with different dimensionality techniques (including PCA, MDS, UMAP), and we refer you to our paper for further details.


Visualising data with a dimensionality reduction function (for example, MDS, LMDS or a dimensionality reduction function you have created yourself):

1) We first need to import the code (a file of functions).

2) We need to obtain the entire population of an algorithm run. If using Platypus, we have provided a function (callbackFunciton) in the example to return the population.

3) If using LMDS decide on the landmarks. 

4) Generate colouring (for exploration/exploitation metric).

3) Transform the population into a NxN proximity matrix (function from sklearn module) or an nxn matrix of landmark points if using LMDS.

4) Decide on the embedding and apply the dimension reduction technique using the functions to return the reduced 2-D population. 

5) We can then plot the 2-D population data with the Visualise function.
